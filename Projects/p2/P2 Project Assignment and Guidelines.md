# 📌 Project Guidelines

## 👤 Individual Projects

- Each project idea is assigned to **multiple individuals**, but every person must develop the project **completely on their own**.
- This is **not a group project**.
- There is **no collaboration** within the same project idea.

## 🧠 Unique & Independent Implementation

- Even if multiple students are working on the same project idea, the implementation must be **entirely unique**.
- Do **not** copy:
  - Code
  - Database schema
  - UI design
  - API structure
  - Business logic
  - Folder structure

Your project must reflect your own design decisions and understanding.

## ⚙️ Full Ownership

Each individual must independently handle:

- Requirement analysis  
- Database design  
- Backend development  
- Frontend (if applicable)  
- Testing  
- Documentation  
- Deployment (if required)  

## 🚫 No Code Sharing

- Sharing code or project files is strictly prohibited.
- Using someone else’s project as a base or reference implementation is not allowed.
- Plagiarism will lead to strict evaluation penalties.

## 🎯 Evaluation Criteria

Projects will be evaluated based on:

- Originality  
- Code quality  
- Architecture decisions  
- Feature completeness  
- Depth of understanding during viva  

Build it yourself. Own every line of it.
